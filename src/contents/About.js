        <p>
          I'm a full stack web developer and software engineer based out of New
          York City. After working multiple years in operations primarily in the
          non-profit sectory, I decided to take a leap of faith to pursue a
          career in software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          with over 3 years of experience in operations, administration and
          project management in the nonprofit sector - specifically, with a
          strong focus on creating equitable access to abortion in the U.S. Iâ€™ve
          had a great privilege and honor to work with organizations and
          projects that have had tremendous meaning to me in the past, but I did
          not feel content with my contributions through my previous roles. I
          felt limited in my capacity through administrative and operational
          work, and wanted to find a path that would allow me to see more
          tangible results of my labor. During my previous role, I had the
          chance to work with a team of developers to create a data
          visualization map of the current(and potential future) state of access
          to abortion across the U.S. That was my first insight into what
          developers do, and my interest was peaked. From there I began
          exploring coding classes online and began on my path to become a full
          stack engineer. With newly minted technical skills in the PERN stack
          and a strong background working in the non-profit sector, I hope to
          bring my experience to an inclusive organization in tech.
